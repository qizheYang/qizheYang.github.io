    <h2>Works and Projects before College</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
        <li>
            <h3>IB Geography Extended Essay</h3>
            <p>
                Carrying out field trips by myself, I examined the water quality,
                specifically transparency, concentration of dissolved salts including NO3-, NO2-,
                and NH3-N, EC, and TDS, and air quality, specifically concentration of CO2, CO, and
                amount of PM2.5, around two major water bodies: Jinji Lake, where the famous CBD
                surrounds, and Baitang, where an eco park is built. <br> <br>
                Conducted online research on government resources and agencies to gather past records.
                I compared these records with my measurements to conclude the overall
                improvements in both air and water quality in Suzhou Industrial Park over
                four decades. <br> <br>
                Received an A rank in assessment. <br> <br>

            <h3>CECA Researcher</h3>
            <p>
                Conducted virtual research on the environmental impact of new construction at Hongwan Port, Zhuhai. <br> <br>
                Used geospatial analysis tools (Google Earth, satellite imagery) to overlap white dolphin habitats with construction plans. <br> <br>
                Assessed the environmental risks of marine pollution and destruction of mangroves, recommending sustainable construction practices to minimize ecological damage. <br> <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Envirothon Researcher</h3>
            <p>
                Conducted research with a team on the ability of soy plants (Glycine Max Merr.) to eliminate excessive nitrogen near waterways in suburban Shanghai (Songjiang). <br> <br>
                Applied environmental science methodologies and field research techniques to assess the sustainability of nitrogen reduction through natural methods. <br> <br>
                Verified findings through literature reviews and scientific field experiments, confirming the effectiveness of soy as a sustainable approach for nitrogen reduction. <br> <br>
                Won national first prize. <br> <br>

            <h3>BaoSteel Institute Researcher</h3>
            <p>
                Conducted researches in domestic ventilation designs. <br> <br>
                Utilized ANSYS software to model and analyze the basement of personal residence. <br> <br>
                Utilized computer simulations on various fluents, including carbon dioxide and
                oxygen, to develop improved designs that reduce the risk of fires endangering individuals or causing damage to furniture. <br> <br>
                The research is guided by Dr. Sanbin Ren from BaoSteel, Shanghai. <br> <br>
